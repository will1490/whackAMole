Exercise 3 - Whack-A-Mole
Whack-A-Mole

Let's create a simple Whack-A-Mole clone.

Feel free to create a repository for this exercice.

The goal of this traditional game is to prevent "moles" from coming out the ground with a hammer. Every second a new "mole" appears and you'll have to click on it to gently tell her to go back into the soil where it belongs. The game doesn't have to picture moles, or animal cruelty you can simply display circle <div>s to begin with. Everytime you click on a mole, your score increases.

If you'd like to spice things up, you can create an increasing difficulty by reducing the timeframe in which the mole appears, and by introducing random delay time between the mole apparition.

Here is a badly drawn example to get you started. Let's do this!

If you want to go further ...
Timeouts and Intervals are key elements when building game. You want to

Create a game where enemies move all the time (ex: PacMan, Snake, FlappyBird)
Create a game that involves trajectories and bullets (ex: Pong, Space Invaders)
Create games that involve timers (ex: Bomberman, Timed chess)
You now have every tool you need to build those games, or create a concept of your own.
